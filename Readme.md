# Pubgrade-Sidecar

A microservice which would be co-deployed alongside [pubgrade][pubgrade] to 
listen for update notifications from [pubgrade][pubgrade] and update the 
subscribed service accordingly. The microservice is named as sidecar as it

updates at pubgrade) in cloud native infrastructure at deployment side.
